[16:36:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> that's the first sigil you have to make (and easiest one)
[16:36:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> no
[16:37:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> look it up
[16:38:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> there's some obsidian to pay you pack for it

[16:39:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> so basically you make arcane ashes
[16:39:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> which is really easy
[16:39:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> and then you right click the ground with it and put redstone in it
[16:39:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> and there's your sigil
[16:39:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> you use it to see how much blood is in your altar or in your blood network

[16:46:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> :|
[16:46:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> maybe in a creative single player world?
[16:46:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> that is work

[16:47:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> look up how people make their houses then
[16:47:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> my house is kinda shit atm, but it's functional
[16:47:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> but it looks nice
[16:47:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> the second floor doesn't match and it's a block outward
[16:47:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> which was accidental
[16:47:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> and im too lazy to fix it
[16:48:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> you want some iron?
[16:48:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i mean sure, thanks
[16:48:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i think i'll be good on iron for a while tho
[16:48:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i found a mine shaft yesterday, looking for diamonds
[16:48:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> tons of EVERY OTHER ore
[16:48:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> but no diamonds
[16:48:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> go mining
[16:49:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> yeah yeah, i'll do botania first
[16:49:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> how do you think i have so many resources?
[16:49:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> how many diamonds do you have?
[16:49:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> right now ~20
[16:49:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> oh ok
[16:49:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i still have a lot of resources
[16:49:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> juts not diamonds
[16:49:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> hence how i got so far in blood magic
[16:50:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i have gone mining, it's just boring to do
[16:50:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> have you gone to the nether?
[16:50:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> yeah
[16:51:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> probably easier for you though since you can fly
[16:51:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> besides killling enemies, i also need blaze rods
[16:51:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> have you found any?
[16:51:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> and yeah it's fun flying in the nether
[16:51:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> i was trying to find fortress
[16:51:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> but it's not easy
[16:51:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i guess it's my job to find it, since i can move around the easiest
[16:51:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> yeah
[16:51:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i'll probably do that sometime today
[16:51:54] [Server thread/WARN]: Sir_Jhaeros moved wrongly!
[16:52:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> but imma start botania first
[16:52:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> i'll be back at my base
[16:52:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> when you do go to look for a fortress, take enough obsidian to make a portal and
[16:52:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> portal your way out
[16:52:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <AwesomeOutcast> then mark on world map
[16:53:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> ohhh good idea
[16:53:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Sir_Jhaeros> yeah i have plenty of obsidian
